  Any :params we pass to the socket constructor in socket.js will be used here in connect as the first argument.

  We pass a max_age, ensuring that tokens are only valid for a certain period of time
  If the token is valid, we receive the user_id and store it in our socket.assigns while returning {:ok, socket}

  If the token is invalid, we return :error, denying the connection attempt by the client.
